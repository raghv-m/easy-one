# Landing Page Fix - Modal Positioning Issue

## 🔧 Issue Found & Fixed

### Problem
The landing page was showing a blank screen because the modal close buttons had incorrect positioning.

### Root Cause
The close buttons had `absolute` positioning but were inside `fixed` divs without `relative` positioning on the parent modal container.

### Solution
Added `relative` class to all modal containers so the `absolute` positioned close buttons would work correctly.
